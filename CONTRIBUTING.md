# Contributing to Psychometricist-AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project follows a structured and review-driven development process to ensure scientific rigor, reproducibility, and code quality.

---

## 📌 General Principles

- All changes MUST start from an Issue.
- Pull Requests without a related and assigned Issue will be rejected.
- All changes must pass CI before merging.
- Only administrators can merge into `main`.

---

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

1. Open a new Issue using the "Bug Report" template.
2. Provide:
   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Environment details
3. Wait for validation by maintainers.
4. If confirmed, the Issue will be labeled and possibly assigned.

Once assigned, a contributor may implement a fix and open a Pull Request referencing the Issue.

---

## ✨ Requesting Enhancements

1. Open an Issue using the "Enhancement" template.
2. Clearly describe:
   - The problem
   - The proposed solution
   - Scientific or technical motivation
3. DO NOT open a Pull Request before approval.
4. A maintainer will review and, if accepted, label it as `assigned`.

Only after assignment may a Pull Request be opened.

---

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

Pull Requests must:

- Reference the related Issue using:
  Closes #<issue_number>
- Be based on a feature branch (never directly on main)
- Pass all CI checks
- Include tests if applicable
- Update documentation if necessary

Pull Requests without an assigned Issue will be closed.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Standards

Before submitting a PR:

- Ensure tests pass locally
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes
- Follow project code style
- Ensure reproducibility where relevant

---

## 🔬 Scientific Integrity

This project aims to maintain methodological transparency and reproducibility.

Contributors must:
- Clearly justify algorithmic or psychometric changes
- Document assumptions
- Avoid introducing unvalidated claims

Maintainers may request additional validation before merging.

---

## 🔐 Governance

- Only administrators can merge into `main`.
- At least one review approval is required.
- Maintainers reserve the right to reject changes not aligned with project goals.

Thank you for contributing to a rigorous and open scientific project.
